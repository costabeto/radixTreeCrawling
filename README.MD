## Radix Tree Crawler

This is a project that aims to carry out a study on search engines, indexing and web crawling, for the evaluation of the subject "Algorithm Analysis Project".

#### Description

Using the text of the book provided, the program will start the indexing procedure using the [Crawler Test website](https://crawler-test.com/), registering the words of the book and later the links of sites that refer to these words.
